# General Programming Strategies

- Break the problem and solution down into the smallest pieces possible.
- Work incrementally. Get one piece working before moving to the next, even if it's just printing out a variable.
- “Printf debugging”: the printf comes from C, but the idea is just to print out the state of various variables and such to figure out what’s going wrong.
- Pseudocode always helps; it’s much easier to think through the problem before diving into trying to code it.
- Find the documentation.
- Google is your friend. It’s a skill. We both Google regularly while programming; there’s no shame and it doesn’t mean you’re “not a good enough programmer”. 
- Look for examples, but don’t get too caught up in them if they aren’t quite right for what you need. And make sure you understand them, rather than just trying to copy.
- Take a break. A little time and space does wonders for a stuck brain.
- Rubber duck it: https://blog.wsol.com/how-a-rubber-duck-taught-me-to-be-a-better-programmer. Talking to someone, anyone, can be a huge help in understanding and solving a problem.
- Hello, World. If you’re just starting with a language, looking for an example of the classic “hello world” program can help give you some basic orientation.
