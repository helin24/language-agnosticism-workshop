# "Easier" Problem (for getting started)

## Problem Description
### Part 1
Write a function that takes an input argument of a multi-word string and prints or returns the longest word. It should roughly work like this:
```
sentence_string = "This is a long sentence with words of multiple lengths for inputting into your function"

find_largest_word_function(sentence_string)

# inputting
```

### Part 2
Modify your function to group words by how many letters they have, and print out the groups.
```
sentence_string = "This is a long sentence with words of multiple lengths for inputting into your function"

print_groups_by_length(sentence_string)

# 1
# a
# 
# 2
# is
# of
#
# 3
# for
...
# 9
# inputting
```

### Part 3
Modify your function to grab user input for the string to analyze rather than taking in an argument.

### Part 4
There are unlimited ways to analyze a group of words - think of other ways to analyze sentences and do it in your function!
