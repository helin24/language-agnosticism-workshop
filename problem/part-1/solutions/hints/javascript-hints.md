# Javascript Part 1 Hints
- Look up a method for splitting up a string into an array of strings
- Strings have a `.length` attribute
- Use a classic for loop that increments i from 0 to 1-less-than-number-of-elements-in-array and uses i to reference each element at each index. Donâ€™t use for-in for arrays.
- Print with `console.log(variable_to_debug)`
- Use `+` to append strings and variable values
