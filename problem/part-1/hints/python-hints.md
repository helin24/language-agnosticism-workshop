# Python Part 1 Hints
- Methods that may be useful:
  - Splitting up a string into a list of strings
  - Getting the length of a string
  - `format`, for inserting variable values into a string that's being printed
- Indentation is very important; tabs indicate blocks/scope, such as whatâ€™s inside a for loop or if statement
	```
	for item in list:
		# Do something for every item in the list, regardless of conditional
		if condition is True:
			#Do something to every item where condition is True
	# Do something outside the for loop
	```
- Quotation marks can be single or double
