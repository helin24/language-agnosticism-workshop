## Problem Description
Note that all of the code samples below are pseudocode.

### Part 1
Start with a sentence, and write code that prints out the longest word. It should work roughly like this:
```
sentence = "This is a long sentence with words of multiple lengths for inputting into your function"

# Add some code here!
# more code
# and then it should print out...

# => "inputting"
```

### Part 2
Since we don't want to copy and paste the code from Part 1 every time we need the longest word, create a **function** that encapsulates your code. Something like...
```
sentence = "This could be any sentence"

define function longest_word_from_sentence(sentence_string):
  # Add your code here!
end

# Then use your function...
longest_word_from_sentence(sentence)

# => "sentence"
```

### Part 3
Modify your function to group words by how many letters they have, and print out the groups.
```
sentence_string = "This is a long sentence with words of multiple lengths for inputting into your function"

print_groups_by_length(sentence_string)

# 1
# a
# 
# 2
# is
# of
#
# 3
# for
...
# 9
# inputting
```

### Part 4
Modify your function to grab user input for the string to analyze rather than taking in an argument.

### Part 5
There are unlimited ways to analyze a group of words - think of other ways to analyze sentences and do it in your function!
