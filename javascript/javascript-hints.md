# Javascript Part 1 Hints
- Methods and attributes that may be useful:
	- Method for splitting up a string into an array of strings
	- Strings have a `.length` attribute
	- Arrays have a `.length` attribute
- Print with `console.log(variableToDebug)`
- Use `+` to concatenate strings and variable values
	```
	toPrint = 'The variable's value is ' + variableToDebug
	```
- Iteration should be done with a classic for loop. Donâ€™t use for-in loops with arrays.
