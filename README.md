# What is this?
This is a workshop where we practice coding in different programming languages, in the process discussing similarities/differences between languages, strategies for moving between languages, and the benefits of being able to do this.

## Goals
For everyone
- Talk about different languages
- Work with other people on programming problems

For those who are getting started in programming
- Get some guidance on what languages may be good starting points
- Allay anxieties about choosing the "wrong" language
- Start recognizing patterns across different languages

For those who have been programming in one language
- Apply what you've learned in one language to getting into another one
- Gain confidence in learning another language and feel comfortable applying/networking for jobs listing skills outside of your experience

For those who have been programming in multiple languages already
- Share your experiences of why you've moved around and how it's felt
- Practice with any unfamiliar languages and note whether you can improve processes for researching and learning
